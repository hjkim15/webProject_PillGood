Intro.

We all die one day.
Till that day, we all want to stay healthy. Unfortunately, human beings are very fragile, and so, we need to take pills quite often.
This page is designed for those ill people, who don’t wish to go to a hospital, nor wish to read complicated medicine prescriptions.

Through our website, you will have access to the minimum information you must know to decide which pill to take for your condition.
To match our objectives, we named our website ‘PILLGOOD”, like Feelgood, cause you feel better when you take pills, and that is basically why we came up with this website.
